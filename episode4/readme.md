| [Uzma Saman Chanderki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uzmasaman/) | [GNS3 + Terraform Provider = “Nice Try.” GNS3 + Orchestrator = “Okay, Now We’re Talking.”](./NetAutoDec.pdf) | Uzma showed us the [Terraform Provider](https://github.com/NetOpsChic/terraform-provider-gns3) she created for GNS3, but not enough, she also made an [orchestrator](https://github.com/NetOpsChic/netdevops-cli-tool) so the environment heals itself according to the source of truth which is in a YAML file. |
| [Florian Loehden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-loehden/) | [Discussion on IPv6](./NetAuto-m4-ipv6.pdf) | As IPv6 is already 25 years old, the question comes: Why isn't it already more distributed nowadays? Look into the repository to get some insights: [Repository](https://github.com/floehden/ipv6) |
